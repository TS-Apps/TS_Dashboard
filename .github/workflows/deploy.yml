## What Changed

Your error shows you're downloading **v3** versions:
```
actions/checkout@v3          ← WRONG
actions/setup-node@v3        ← WRONG
actions/configure-pages@v3   ← WRONG
actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2  ← WRONG
```

Must be **v4** (except upload-pages-artifact which is v3):
```
actions/checkout@v4          ← CORRECT
actions/setup-node@v4        ← CORRECT
actions/configure-pages@v4   ← CORRECT
actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3  ← CORRECT
actions/deploy-pages@v4      ← CORRECT
```
